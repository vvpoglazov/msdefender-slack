# Progress Tracking

## What Works

The following components have been implemented but require testing:

1. **Lambda Functions**:
   - Alert Processor Lambda function for processing real-time notifications
   - Summary Generator Lambda function for daily reports

2. **Library Components**:
   - Defender Client for Microsoft Defender API interaction
   - Slack Client for Slack message delivery
   - Alert Formatter for Slack message formatting
   - Summary Formatter for report generation
   - Secret Manager for secure credential handling

3. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Terraform configuration for AWS resources
   - API Gateway setup for webhook reception
   - EventBridge configuration for scheduled reports
   - IAM roles and policies

## Recent Progress

1. **Python Implementation**: 
   - Implemented core Lambda functions in Python
   - Created library modules for API clients and formatting
   - Added error handling and logging

2. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Defined AWS resources using Terraform
   - Configured API Gateway for webhook endpoint
   - Set up EventBridge for scheduled reports
   - Created IAM roles with appropriate permissions

3. **Integration Components**:
   - Implemented Microsoft Defender client for API interaction
   - Created Slack client for message delivery
   - Developed message formatting using Slack Block Kit

## Current Status

The project has made significant progress from the planning phase to implementation. Core Lambda functions for alert processing and summary generation have been developed in Python. The Terraform infrastructure code has been created, defining all necessary AWS resources. Library components for API interaction and message formatting are in place. The next steps involve setting up testing, deployment pipelines, and finalizing the external integrations with Microsoft Defender and Slack.

## Current Metrics
- Components Completed: 75%
- Infrastructure Setup: 80%
- Microsoft Defender Integration: 60%
- Slack Integration: 60%
- Notification Service: 90%
- Daily Reports: 80%
- Testing Coverage: 10%

## Known Issues

1. Testing coverage is limited and needs to be expanded.
2. CI/CD pipeline not yet established for automated deployment.
3. Need to implement dead letter queues for handling failed messages.
4. API Gateway security may need enhancement for production use.

## Upcoming Milestones
