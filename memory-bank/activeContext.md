# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is in the initial setup phase. We are establishing the foundational infrastructure and starting with the core implementation. The main focus areas are:

1. Setting up the AWS infrastructure using Terraform
2. Implementing the basic Lambda functions for alert processing
3. Creating the webhook integration with Microsoft Defender
4. Establishing the Slack message delivery system

## Recent Changes

As this is the project initialization, there are no recent changes to document yet. This section will be updated as the project progresses.

## Next Steps

1. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Create Terraform configuration for AWS resources
   - Set up remote state management in S3
   - Define IAM roles and policies

2. **Microsoft Defender Integration**:
   - Register application in Azure AD
   - Configure webhook settings
   - Implement authentication mechanism

3. **Slack Integration**:
   - Create Slack app and bot
   - Generate and store API tokens
   - Test basic message delivery

4. **Lambda Implementation**:
   - Develop alert processing function
   - Implement message formatting
   - Create severity filtering logic

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Language Selection**: 
   - TypeScript was chosen for Lambda implementation for its type safety and developer experience.
   - This will help prevent runtime errors and improve maintainability.

2. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - Microsoft Defender API authentication will use client credentials flow.
   - Tokens will be cached and refreshed as needed to minimize authentication overhead.

3. **Message Format Design**:
   - Currently evaluating Slack Block Kit for rich message formatting.
   - Need to decide on consistent formatting for different alert types.

4. **Development Environment**:
   - Local development will use AWS SAM for Lambda testing.
   - Infrastructure changes will be tested in a development AWS account before production.

5. **API Gateway Security**:
   - Need to determine if additional authentication is required for the webhook endpoint.
   - Considering using API keys or other mechanisms to secure the endpoint.

6. **Scheduling Logic**:
   - Evaluating the best approach for implementing weekday-only scheduling.
   - Need to handle time zone considerations for the 9:00 AM trigger time.

## Current Blockers

1. Need AWS account credentials and appropriate permissions.
2. Awaiting Microsoft Defender API access approval.
3. Need to create Slack workspace and obtain appropriate permissions.

## Current Questions

1. Should the system support multiple Slack channels for different alert types?
2. What is the expected volume of alerts from Microsoft Defender?
3. Are there any compliance requirements for alert retention?
4. What is the expected format for the daily summary reports?
