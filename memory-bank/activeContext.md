# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project has progressed from the initial setup phase to implementation of core components. The focus has shifted to:

1. Completing and refining the Python Lambda functions for alert processing and summary generation
2. Finalizing the Terraform infrastructure configuration
3. Implementing the Microsoft Defender and Slack integrations
4. Setting up deployment and testing pipelines

## Recent Changes

1. **Python Implementation Progress**: Created Lambda functions for alert processing and summary generation
2. **Library Implementation**: Developed core libraries for Defender client, Slack client, alert formatting, and summary formatting
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Created Terraform configuration for AWS resources including Lambda, API Gateway, EventBridge, and IAM roles

## Next Steps

1. **Infrastructure Deployment**:
   - Finalize Terraform configuration
   - Set up S3 backend for remote state
   - Deploy infrastructure to development environment

2. **Microsoft Defender Integration**:
   - Complete the implementation of the Defender client
   - Test authentication and alert retrieval
   - Validate webhook functionality

3. **Slack Integration**:
   - Complete the Slack client implementation
   - Test message formatting
   - Validate channel delivery

4. **Lambda Testing**:
   - Develop unit tests for Python functions
   - Set up integration test environment
   - Test with sample data

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Authentication Handling**: 
   - Implemented secret management for API keys using AWS Secrets Manager
   - Created dedicated client for Microsoft Defender authentication

2. **Message Format Design**:
   - Implemented Slack Block Kit for rich message formatting
   - Created formatter modules for alerts and summaries
   - Need to refine formatting for better readability

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added structured error handling to Lambda functions
   - Need to implement dead letter queues for failed messages
   - Consider adding fallback notification mechanism

4. **Scheduling Logic**:
   - Implemented conditional logic for Monday vs. weekday reports
   - Using EventBridge cron expressions for scheduling
   - Need to test timezone handling

5. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Need to implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Should use separate environments for development, testing, and production
   - Need to handle secret management in deployment pipeline

## Current Blockers

1. Need to finalize testing strategy and implementation
2. Deployment pipeline not yet established
3. Need API credentials for end-to-end testing

## Current Questions

1. How to best handle rate limiting for Microsoft Defender API?
2. What metrics should be collected for monitoring system health?
3. Should we implement backup notification mechanism if Slack is unavailable?
4. How to handle updates to alert formats from Microsoft Defender?
